# BookOrganizer
You can set a book with its specifications like name , author , publish year and finally you can put it into categories **Is Read** if you have read this book or **To Read** 
if you want to read it.And after adding the book you do something on it like:
- #### Adding this book to your favorites.
- #### Edit its information whenever you want.
- #### And finally you can simply delete it.
